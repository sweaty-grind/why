# why

guys...  why am i fighting you for a few hundred here and there???  you waste my time with your wavelength shit.  like sir, i dont enjoy this and will be lodging a complaint...

so yeah after that i dont know what else is supposed to be done here.  perhap sir, you are trying to keep it breathing but the failure was too high i wonder when you would give up at...  so i spend it keeping people alive and i send some to the dumpsters..  i dont know bro.  if the choice was this simple all the time lol...  oh well we go fix shit and we come back right???  so these things are consuming my days...  so i dohnt know bro. i'm clueless again..l. perhaps that you left it to shit is how the current deal is.
