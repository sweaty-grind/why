# why

so you know... you think you are doing shit i wonder your cost analysis benefit measurement.  you know?  wasting my time.  what kind of stupid retard reality is this?  i wonder sometimes bro.  that i didn't fix things when i had the chance to do so.  so i come here all the damn time and you aren't getting it.  did you want to die or something???

its called being stupid.   idiots and losers are stupid bro.  why did we spend so much time on this shit my head is gonna blow up.

so yeah, i drink monsters right now and parsing my own head lol.  dude, this ain't my natural brain.  its like i'm wearing a cap with electrodes...  or some shit like that.

so the us came by with their might and you did nothing again.  and i dont have my monees.  wtf for real??? no monees?? wtf???

this is lame my friend.  i am too nice to you. i dont even care to do anything about anything.  lame you think your privilege would save your life lol...

so its a confusing time right now.  i am supposed to be compensated if this was a job...  that someone calls work.  i dont know bro.  i feel lyour stupidity is what draws me here.  that we have unfinished business.  you weasal too much of my shit i couldn't tell what i was doing.  you screwed up my energy expenditure by asking for too many hours and too many days go by that every day i wonder if this works out the way you wanted it to.  cause its what you caused i would at least man up and do shit.  oh well who cares. i treat you like you can only manage one or two brain cells...

why you ask stupid things from me anyways???  you guys are sitting there basking in my works and you complain to me that i'm whacking too many people.
